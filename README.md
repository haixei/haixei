<h2>Welcome.</h2>
<p>My name is Aleksandra and I work with Python and R to create useful applications and insightful data analysis. I solve problems, design the code and make the best tea. I'm open for Kaggle competitions, hackathons, as well as conferences. Hit me up at Twitter if I can help you with anything!</p>

### What do I do?
I work mostly with Python to create a variety of software. In my free time I self-study statistics and advocate for data security. My projects often involve frameworks like Vue and Django, Flask for smaller things and I'm also not afraid to use strongly typed languages. The projects you can find on my GitHub account will make the most sense for you if you already have some background in programming and like to read README's! I always write documentation and comment my code, as well as leave additional resources to better understand the problems I tackle :)

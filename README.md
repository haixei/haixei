<h2>Welcome.</h2>
<p>I work with Python to create useful applications and insightful data analysis. I solve problems, write comments and never forget about testing.
In free time I advocate for data security and learn about statistics. You will have the best time using my repositories if you enjoy reading README's
and happen to have some experience with programming.</p>
